<!-- Format
    It is possible to give relative values (factors and more) for each property.

    The format as a regex is: ([+-*/](%d+|x))*
    An empty value means no change, a value without sign or with a '-' replaces
    the previous value. If an operator prefixes the string, e.g. *1.5 (- doesn't
    work because it's a sign). x will get replaced by the previous value which
    means *1.5 is equal to x*1.5. It's also possible to combine operations:
    +1.5*20 means "add 1.5 to the previous value and then multiply by 20".
    Note that it's computed sequentially from left to right and there is no
    operator precedence. Also whitespaces aren't allowed because they are used
    to split arrays.
    If you want to return the square of something use x*x or only *x.

    ATTENTION: '-' is a special case if it is the first character of a number-
    string. It means that the number is negative and NOT that the following
    float will be subtracted from the base value. So if x = 10 and the string
    "-5" is processed, the result will be -5 and not the same as "x-5", which
    would result in 10 - 5 = 5.

            downward-impulse-factor: A speed proportional impulse applied each

            track-connection-accel: An artificial force that pulls a wheel to
                the ground if its off ground. Reduces the affect if a kart loses
                contact with the ground (i.e. it then can't steer or accelerate
                anymore).
            angular-factor: Factor to change angular impulses. X and Z rotations
                are damped to avoid that karts in a collision are too easily pushed

        <!-- Turning
            radius: The turn radius of the kart at
                a given speed. The actual steering angle is dependent on the
                wheel base of the kart: radius = wheel_base/sin(steering_angle).
                The values below define that at speed 0 the turn radius is 2, at
                speed 10 the radius is 7.5 etc.
                The actual turn radius is piece-wise linearly interpolated. This
                allows for tighter turning at lower speeds, and also avoids that
                the kart becomes too hard to control at high speed (speeds
                higher than 25 can only be reached with powerups).
            time-full-steer: This is the amount of change in steering depending
                on current steering. So if the steering is between 0 and 0.5,
                the time-for-steering-change is 0.17. If the current steering is
                between 0.5 and 1.0, the time-for-steering-change is 0.28.
                The speed is used as dt/time-for-steering-change.
                In short: steering at less than halfway is somewhat faster,
                but slower when you want to steer more, which should avoid
                oversteering (by pressing the key for too long)
                If the kart is currently in the direction opposite to the
                required steering ("negative steering"), the time-full-steer
                at 0 is used.

            time-till-max: Time till maximum skidding is reached.
            visual: Additional graphical rotation of kart. The graphical rotation
                of the kart also determines the direction the kart is driving to
                when skidding is stopped.
            visual-time: How long it takes for the visual skid to reach maximum.
            revert-visual-time: how long it takes when stopping a skid to revert
                the visual skid and bring visuals and physics in sync again.
            min-speed: Minimum speed a kart must have before it can skid. Must be
                >0, otherwise the kart can skid at the start of the race.

                The additional engine force is not active during fade-out.
            bonus-force: Additional engine force (this is used to offset the fact
                that turning after skidding (e.g. to correct direction) often uses
                up the skid bonus).
            post-skid-rotate-factor: a factor to be used to determine how much
                the chassis of a kart should rotate to match the graphical view.
                A factor of 1 is identical, a smaller factor will rotate the kart

            reduce-turn-min/max: The steering done by the controller (which is in

                is active (for left turn, right turn will use [-max, -min]). The

            base-speed: the speed for which length and width are valid.
                They are upscaled when faster and downscaled when slower.
            length: How far behind a kart slipstream works
                (note : this helps OTHER karts)
            width: how wide slipstream works furthest away from the kart.
            inner-factor: The proportion of the slipstreaming area with
                twice faster slipstream "credits" collection.

                1 means it last as long the total time collected
