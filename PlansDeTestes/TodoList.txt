Here's a list of things to do or correct 

Bug (1-5):
	- The second sub-mode of the zombie tag game (tag-zombie survivor powerful) doesn't work (the game ends much too early isRaceOver() method) (FIX)
	- When gifts, banners, nitro are disabled, it doesn't always work (FIX) (TO BE VALIDATED)
	- Very recent bug: reloadable powers no longer work as they should. Just zips to infinity, which is not normal (FIX)
	- The code for the victory counters of the Team-Arena game modes (in world.cpp) depending on the team chosen is commented out as the code is causing problems (FIX)
	- The information in the victory screen seems to be mixed up (FIX)
	- Correct the placement of information in the victory screen. Correct visuals 
	- Certain powers, such as the parachute and the anvil, mismanage the team condition (don't touch a member of your team).
	- When you choose your team online with the selection screen, the kart is always tux (we never managed to display the right kart).
	- Configuration value for number of tags not correct (save or load) (FIX)
	- Check max number of tags possible
	- Fix generateUniqueRandomNumbers() method to avoid duplicates (FIX)
	- Fixed label text for zombie tag game mode (FIX)
	- Very annoying bug with powers: sometimes the game crashes for no raion and sometimes the basketball is given in the gift (shouldn't be) 
	- The quantity of a power given in tag-zombie-survivor-power mode to a survivor is not correct. The quantity is supposed to be 10 instead of 1 but it doesn't work (TO BE DONE)
	- ???

Improvement (3-7):
	- When hit (the Barril on the ground), the kart should explode instead of receiving a hitBanana() effect (TO BE DONE).
	- When hit by an object (the Barrel on the ground), the Barrel should explode (TO DO)
	- When a game is over, the victory animation is not played (only the defeat animation is played at all times) (TO DO)
	- Make sure our game modes have acceptable default values for online mode (ex: nb the tag = 1, nb life =3, etc...)
	- Improve the third sub-game mode of team-arena-battle (player with the most points) (points player) to make it better and more fun to play.
	- When a kart becomes a zombie, its kart should turn green. It works locally (a kart is recreated and the old one is deleted) but online it sometimes causes problems (the player is disconnected and reconnected very quickly). 
	- Better icons ???

Additional features (7) :
	- Added extra powers such as the tenis ball, the baseball, the voleyball or the oil puddle.
	- Added urn item. This item appears when a player is transformed into a zombie (when the survivor dies). The urn contains a reward. 
	- Added a mini surprise event system for our game mode. Like reducing the recharge time of player powers temporarily for 20s, or disabling the mini-map temporarily for 15s, or etc...
	- Power selection menu (which power will be available in the gift or in the banana)
	- Addition of a fog system or a darkening system (darkness with little light) to give a better atmosphere to the zombie game mode.
	- Added achievements related to our game modes or to the deactivation of gifts, nitro, bananas, etc.
	- Complete local deactivation of gifts, nitro and bananas (grand prize, high score, replay, ghost mode, etc.).

Important (1-1) :
	- Create an installable (doesn't work after all) by (maximum) December 16 in the afternoon (TO BE DONE)
